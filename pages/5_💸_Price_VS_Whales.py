st.write(""" ### Whale Impact Concept ##  """)

st.write("""
The community and investors watch crypto whales because they can significantly influence price movements.
Whales can also create price volatility increases, especially when they move a large quantity of cryptocurrency in one transaction. For example, if an owner is trying to sell their bitcoin for fiat currency, the lack of liquidity and large transaction size creates downward pressure on Bitcoin's price because other market participants see the transaction. When whales sell, other investors go on high alert, watching for indicators that whales are "dumping" their holdings.

Exchanges and custody wallets were taken out before compiling the top 20 NEAR whales. In light of the most recent price changes, we strive to keep an eye on these top 20 whale activities (last 2 weeks).     """)
