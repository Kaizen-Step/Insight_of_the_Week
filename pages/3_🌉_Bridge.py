st.write(""" ### Bridge Concept ##  """)

st.write("""
A blockchain bridge is a tool that lets you port assets from one blockchain to another, solving one of the main pain points within blockchains â€“ a lack of interoperability.
Since blockchain assets are often not compatible with one another, bridges create synthetic derivatives that represent an asset from another blockchain.Some bridges, known as unidirectional or one-way bridges, allow you to port assets only to the target blockchain and not the other way around.Other bridges like Wormhole and Multichain are bidirectional, or two-way, meaning you can freely convert assets to and from blockchains. [[8]](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-blockchain-bridges-and-how-do-they-work/)   
  
Here, we investigated if the price increase would be sufficient to persuade people to bridgeÂ to NEAR Blockchain.

st.write(""" On February 11, which was previously discussed as the day the NEAR price hit its monthly low, there was no bridge transaction. Moreover, February 12 came in second-to-last, while February 15â€”the day with the most bridge transactions to NEARâ€”saw a notable increase in the price of NEAR. 53% of these transaction was from USDC follow by USDT with 17% . As you can see, the number of bridge transactions on February 18 was the same as February 8 and 6, and the number of bridge transactions on the first week of the period when NEAR experienced a significant fall was not lower than February 16, which was the day after NEAR increased. As a result, this increase did not significantly alter the rhythm other than for one or two hype days.
