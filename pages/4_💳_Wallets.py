st.write("""
A crypto wallet (cryptocurrency wallet) is software or hardware that enables users to store and use cryptocurrency.Crypto wallets keep your private keys â€“ the passwords that give you access to your cryptocurrencies â€“ safe and accessible, allowing you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They come in many forms, from hardware wallets like Ledger (which looks like a USB stick) to mobile apps like Coinbase Wallet, which makes using crypto as easy as shopping with a credit card online. [[9]](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-crypto-wallet)  
In this dashboard, each wallet represents a user who uses the wallet, and these two notions are used interchangeably, active wallets are those that have had one or more transactions in a given time period.Â  Let's see if this price increase brings in any new users.  """)

st.write(""" The number of new wallets has dramatically increased as a result of the price hike. Among the features we covered in this dashboard, this measure has the most relevance. As you can see, between February 12 and February 15, the daily number of new wallets roughly doubled (8,196 and 18,148, respectively). Although this trend only persisted for three days, it doubled the weekly cumulative value compared to the first week.
