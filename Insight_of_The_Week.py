### What Is NEAR Blockchain ? ###
NEAR Protocol is software that aims to incentivize a network of computers to operate a platform for developers to create and launch decentralized applications.
Central to NEAR Protocol‚Äôs design is the concept of sharding, a process that aims to split the network‚Äôs infrastructure into several segments in order for computers, also known as nodes, to only have to handle a fraction of the network‚Äôs transactions.  
By distributing segments of the blockchain, rather than the complete blockchain across network participants, sharding is expected to create a more efficient way to retrieve network data and scale the platform.  
NEAR operates in a similar manner to other centralized data storage systems like Amazon Web Services (AWS) that serve as the base layer on which applications are built. But rather than being run by a single entity, NEAR is operated and maintained by a distributed network of computers.  
Just as AWS allows developers to deploy code in the cloud without needing to create their own infrastructure, NEAR Protocol facilitates a similar architecture built around a network of computers and its native cryptocurrency, the NEAR token.[[1]](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-near-protocol-and-how-does-it-work)

### Bitcoin price hits $25K in new 2023 high  ###
Despite macroeconomic headwinds and regulatory crackdowns on crypto, Bitcoin has hit a new high for the year. The price of Bitcoin BTC has reached a new 2023 high of $25,000 after surging over much of January. The last time Bitcoin‚Äôs price was around 25,000 was around mid-June, on its way down to between 19,000 and 21,000, where it then hovered for several months, according to data from CoinGecko.  
The price of BTC then took a big dip in November following the FTX crisis, which saw BTC drop to a 2022 low of 15,742 on Nov. 10. Its price began to surge in early January, increasing over 14 consecutive days from Jan. 4-17. That daily green candle streak was its second longest in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs 14-year history ‚Äî having fallen one day short of its 15-day record set in November 2013.[[2]](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-hits-25k-in-new-2023-high)

### Bitcoin Price Correlation With Cryptocurrencies ###
 Bitcoin movement tends to determine the overall direction of crypto currencies, just as the S&P 500 index tends to determine overall stock market direction.This symbiotic relationship means that the value of different crypto currencies is often tied to Bitcoin. As a result, an crypto currencies value is often measured against the price of Bitcoin, so the price of crypto currencies could go down if Bitcoin goes down, and conversely, the price of crypto currencies could go up if Bitcoin goes up.

## Methodology ##  
The NEAR Foundation is running an "Insight of the Week" series. Keeping your analysis short and focused on excellent-quality visualization - provide the most fascinating or illuminating fact or insight that you can about the NEAR ecosystem, or any of the projects building on NEAR, over the past 7 to 14 days. 
During the last 14 days, Bitcoin price reached the 25K resistance line; this sudden rise influenced the whole market as well as the NEAR token price, which experienced a sudden rise this week. We try to evaluate this price rising impact on NEAR users' behavior and find the reason behind this rise besides Bitcoin price. To answer these questions, we first monitored NEAR Price during the last 2 weeks and compared it with Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices and also Matic, Solana and Optimism to better understand the market. Also, find a correlation between NEAR price and other tokens. Then we investigate the impact of this NEAR price increase on Transactions on the NEAR blockchain and Bridges to NEAR and does it attract a significant number of new comers or not. Finally, we monitor the top 20 whales on NEAR  during the last 14 days' transactions to and from CEX exchanges to find patterns that confirm the price rise. In this dashboard, we used "near.core.fact_transactions" and "near.core.fact_transactions" to caculate transactions and label them. We use "near.core.fact_prices" to extract hourly NEAR prices for comparison. All the Metrice presented in this dashboard are calculated from "2023-02-05" up until "2023-02-20".
I am a civil engineer who is trying to be a student in the Data analyst world; please let me know your idea about the project and help me to stand on a shoulder of giants.
